# IPv4OfficeMacros
Some useful macros for processing/manipulating IPv4 addresses

Originally devised to search for firewall, snort and netflow logs in ElasticSearch (created by Graylog).


This code is poor/average, borrowed mostly or written in a hurry (and typically late at night) to achieve a
specific task at that point in time.

Then left to bit rot. Time...

Actually found many of the initial ideas (and the StrJoin code) somewhere else - I need to go look it up again.

It took *quite* some searching to find anything useful for LibreOffice.

Most useful was this resource:
